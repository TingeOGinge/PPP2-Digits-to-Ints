/*
Input - Conversion (char vector to int) - Print 

User inputs a stream of chars, each of which is placed into a vector. 
- Maximum 4 digits to start 

Function needed to convert char vector into a single int 
- i < vector.size(); 
-   10 * x + vector[i]  //This appears to be the correct formula 

Another vector is needed with corresponding unit measurements 
- vector<string>v { "Thousand(s)", "Hundred(s)", "Ten(s)", "One(s)" };

print function will then output the int value, followed by the breakdown of chars and string measurements 
-	cout << value << " is "; 
-	x < charv.size();
-		cout << charv[x] << " " << stringv[i + 4 - charv.size();]
